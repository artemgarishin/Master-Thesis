TODO: briefly explain the used subtree isomorphism algorithms.

The input  for the comparison algorithms are control flow graphs ($CFG$) of a method.
The $CFG$ is defined as a tuple $G=(V, A)$, where  
$V$ is a nonempty set of \textit{vertices} representing instructions of a method,
$A$ is a (possibly empty) set of \textit{arcs} (or edges) representing transitions between the instructions.
Formally, $A$ is the finite set of ordered pairs of vertices $(a, b)$, where $a,b \in V$.
