This paper presents graph algorithms to solve isomorphism problem under directed non-labeled non-weighted graphs. Combinatorial algorithms are presented in this paper for testing isomorphism of unordered trees, finding one of all isomorphisms of a tree as a subtree of another tree. Depending from type of tree, can be ordered/unordered, labeled/non-labeled, the first step would be reasonable to solve the isomorph problem using clear graph theory. Thus, the following algorithms were implemented under unordered and non-labeled trees as a requisites for further development. The main concept of the paper is to define and to visualize isomorphic trees for tree comparison.
