This should be a 1-page (maximum) summary of your work. What environment for development has been used, experimental results 
An abstract is a summary in your own words of the Thesis It is not evaluative and must not include your personal opinions. The purpose of an abstract is to give a reader sufficient information for him or her to decide whether it would be worthwhile reading the entire article or book. An abstract should aim at giving as much information as possible in as few words as possible.

Goal of this work is to search out the most optimal ways to compare different pieces of code. So far there are two techniques for code comparison: a normal text comparison and graph compare. Normal text-compare can be not sufficient to analyse two pieces of code, or to find a similarity between them. For that reason a structural/graph compare opens a doors to discover more possibilities of comparison. 

//TODO define and write here if combination of both can deliver better results for code analyse.
