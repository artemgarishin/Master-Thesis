\chapter{Description of problem}
\label{cha:Description}
To make a contribution into development of structured code compare, the following tasks should be explored:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The existing algorithms must be investigated (The text-compare method is not sufficient to find a similarity in code)
  \item The algorithms for the structured compare(Abstract syntax trees, Control flow graphs) must be explored 
   \item New methods and algorithms find a place to tried out. A prototypes of combination text-compare and structure-compare must be implemented.
   \item Experimental results
\end{enumerate}
