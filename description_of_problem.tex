\chapter{Description of problem}
\label{cha:Description}

In this chapter an issue of the work is being explained. As usual a compare of two codes we can consider them as classes, functions or methods. Thereby a compare can be counted as examinations of two pieces of code, in the best case a methods or functions. They can have a similar implementation or alike syntax, however these two codes are different.

There are many purposes to compare a code, to find out a similarity or determine a difference between them. One of the option is to search for plagiarism in case a code can be taken from external source and a variables have been changed. In addition a general search can be improved to look out a similar code in big projects.

Code is transformed into graphs
there is no deterministic algorithms to compare them because of loops
Graphs - NP complete
The structural compare of trees is not NP-complete problem, it is the reason to compare trees
for trees - yes, graph is into tree transformed

TASK: create a pieces of code and compare them

we need to reduce the problem
we can compare in polynomial time compare trees.

code we transform in tree:
2 questions:
 1. how we transform code in tree
 2. how we compare (BU TD)
 3. how we reference code and nodes(how we put the code difference) 
  	how to lead back the result of the code

TODO: look in internet what exists already 
 
Result must be: source code and difference
 
how i can come from code -> graph
2 strategies:

1. AST from source code(briefly explain what it is)	+ experiments
2. 
small example, what kind of result gives text compare(just string compare) and AST

 public void ast1(){
		if(i > 1) i++;
	}
	
	public void ast1(){
		if(i > 1) 
		i++;
	}
	
For byte code:
spanning tree is created so: one edge in the end is deleted(draw how it deleted and why)

can be optimized: byte code has a number

related works(?)
find some works, where nobody was working before(AST optimize)

IDEA: text difference highlight and in parallel nodes in Tree marks and Matching
(TODO: make some experiments, if it's ok, better, worse or same compare)

Statistic + manual

To investigate code comparison, four algorithms of structural compare are required.
To make a contribution into development of structured code compare, the following tasks should be explored:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The existing algorithms must be investigated (The text-compare method is not sufficient to find a similarity in code)
  \item The algorithms for the structured compare(Abstract syntax trees, Control flow graphs) must be explored 
   \item New methods and algorithms find a place to tried out. A prototypes of combination text-compare and structure-compare can be implemented.
   \item Experimental results of compare must be derived.
\end{enumerate}
